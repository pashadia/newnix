Tabular data is everywhere in the Unix command line. The output of pretty-much every single utility is in the form of tabular data - if you're not sure what it is, think of the way `ls -l` neatly arranges the information into columns.

Sometimes you just need to quickly extract information from tabular data. In the days of old, you would need to pipe the output into tools like `awk` or `sed` and then fudge with the commands until you get what you want -- or give up, as it's happened to me a few times. I can't even imagine how many times I've loaded the `awk` documentation.

In contrast, `choose` is dead simple. In its most basic invocation, you simply pipe in some input and provide the fields you want to extract.

```
$ ps -xu | head | choose 0 1 
USER PID
bogdan 3752
bogdan 3753
bogdan 3766
bogdan 3769
bogdan 3770
bogdan 3774
bogdan 3777
bogdan 3779
bogdan 3781
```

Alternatively, you can provide an inclusive range, like `a:b` or an exclusive one, like `a..b`:

```
$ ps -xu | head -n5 | choose 0:4
USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ
bogdan 3752 0.0 0.0 18456
bogdan 3753 0.0 0.0 173072
bogdan 3766 0.0 0.0 142632
bogdan 3769 1.0 0.0 271572

$ ps -xu | head -n5 | choose 0..4
USER PID %CPU %MEM
bogdan 3752 0.0 0.0
bogdan 3753 0.0 0.0
bogdan 3766 0.0 0.0
bogdan 3769 1.0 0.0

```

 
#### Other usecases

You can specify input field separators with `-f` and output separators with `-o`

```
$ bat input.csv
school, Problem Set 📜, 2050-10-12 10:00
school, Learn how to grow tomatoes 🍅, 2050-09-12 10:00
job, Code the thing 🖥️,  2050-12-12 10:00
personal, Build a defensible homestead 🏡, 2050-01-01 11:11

$ bat input.csv |  choose -f "," -o " ->" 0 1
school -> Problem Set 📜
school -> Learn how to grow tomatoes 🍅
job -> Code the thing 🖥️
personal -> Build a defensible homestead 🏡

```
