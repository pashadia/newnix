title: "Modern Unix tools"
---

Hello, I'm Bogdan.

I'm a software engineer passionate about effective tools. In this blog I'm going to present various CLI tools that make my life easier than arcane, half a century old UNIX tools. Most of these can be used regardless of whether you're using macOS or Linux, and probably work on WSL as well, although I have no interest in trying it.

The intended audience is developers, network admins and data scientists, who spend a big chunk of time in the console, or who could benefit greatly from it.
